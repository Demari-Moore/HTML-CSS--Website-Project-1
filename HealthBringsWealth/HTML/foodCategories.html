        <p>Hi everyone, I know it has been a while. This Covid-19/Corona/Rona/Ro-Ro virus has me living a little more relaxed than usual. Since I am stuck indoors due to the UK lock down/social-distancing/self-isolation/quarantine... I honestly don’t know
            what to refer to these things as anymore. The anxiety that it has caused, has me just taking everything a day at a time, with not much motivation if I am entirely honest. <br> <br> As you UK viewers are aware, most fast food chains are closed.
            Therefore, feeling for a ‘cheeky Nandos’ means either reminiscing on when you last had one, fantasising about next year when you MIGHT be able to go out again and dine there... OR getting creative and making your own. Luckily for us, we had
            a sachet of Nandos rub, some peri peri salt and veggies that are reaching their use-by date. So I decided to be creative and treat ourselves to a DIY vegan Nandos Friday night dinner. <br> <br> I must say, the food turned out really well,
            I am quite proud of myself. Therefore, it is only right that I sit and write the recipe. Plus it is a great way to come back to the blog... and jog my memory when I want to make this again. To be honest, in my defense a lot of the things that
            I have made recently would require a food scale which I currently don’t have, and with the current climate... I am not entirely thrilled about heading out to get a replacement. So I am waiting on my 14 day delivery. Can you believe that? What
            would usually arrive within 2 – 3 days is now taking 14! <br> <br> All negativity and complaining aside, this pandemic has shun a light on our lifestyles. It is sad and with all of what is going on, death tolls rising and people losing loved
            ones to the virus, it is upsetting. However, it is forcing us to spend time with loved ones (for those of us who live with people). We are making healthier home cooked meals and fishing out recipes and remedies to boost pour immune system
            naturally. A lot of us finally got time to rest and attend to the jobs around the house we have been putting off for so long. As well as reaching out to people who we haven’t been in contact with for a while. Therefore, during all of this
            gloom and uncertainty, there is still gratitude to be expressed. <br> <br> So! Without further delay and to cheer you up after my mini philosophical moment, here is the recipe: <br> <br>

            <h2>Vegan Brunch Fried Dumplings and Veg</h2>

            <p>Despite the weather here in London I managed to go to the gym this morning. Even though I was working out, my mind was on brunch because I only had a banana before heading out. It’s Saturday and I have been having smoothies for breakfast all
                week. So I decided to go all out on brunch, Jamaican style. I decided to make fried dumplings with steamed vegetables and plantain. I have never been able to fry dumplings properly without milk. However, now that I am following a vegan
                diet, I had to give the old fashioned way a try. I must say... they didn't turn out too badly Hahah! My Momma will be proud!</p>

            <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">

                <li>1 Ripe Plantain</li>

                <li>1 Small Bag of Baby Spinach</li>
                <li>¼ Green Bell Pepper</li>
                <li>¼ Red Bell Pepper</li>
                <li>2 Spring Onions</li>
                <li>1 Garlic Clove (Small)</li>
                <li>¼ Scotch Bonnet (Small)... Adjust to your spice preference</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Plant Butter</li>
                <li>1 Tsp All Purpose Seasoning</li>
                <li>Salt & Black Pepper to Taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="ingredients">Fried Dumplings;</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">

                <li>1 ½ Cup Vegetable Oil</li>

                <h2 class="ingredients">Cooking Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>To fry the dumplings add oil to a frying pan and put it on low heat. In a mixing bowl combine all dry ingredients and knead in the water slowly until you have a smooth, non-sticky dough. You can add more water if the flour doesn’t
                        combine or more flour if there is too much water. Remember to add more baking powder if you do add more flour.</li>
                    <li>When your dough has been formed, separate the dough into small equal sized balls. Roll each portion into a small smooth ball then flatten and add to the oil.</li>
                    <li>Gage the heat between low and medium to ensure that dumplings are golden on each side, this should take a minimum of 5 minutes total.</li>
                    <li>Remove cooked dumplings from the frying pan and place on a plate covered with paper towel to soak up any excess oil.</li>
                    <li>Add butter to pot and leave it on a low heat to melt whilst you dice all peppers, garlic and spring onions. Add diced items to melted butter and turn the heat up to sauté vegetables for 1 minute. Add all purpose seasoning and sauté
